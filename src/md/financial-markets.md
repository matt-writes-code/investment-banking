# Financial Markets
Financial markets refer to markets where players can trade securities. Trades can take place electronically or physical places like exchanges and counters. The
- Capital markets are long-term finances and trade for more than a year. They provide businesses and governments with long-term funding.
- Money markets are short-term finances and trade for less than a year. They provide businesses with credit and liquidity over a short-term to meet working capital requirements.

## Capital markets

Capital markets are markets that connect investor funds and institutions that need them. Investors enter capital markets with the intention of growing money they own, whereas institutions borrow funds for business expansion and day-to-day operations. Capital markets are divided in to two markets. 

- Primary markets: These are markets where institutions offer securities to investors for the first time, like an Initial Public Offering (IPO). This is the only time where institutions receive the money. New securities issued are also part of the primary market.
- Secondary markets: This market is where investors trade securities already issued. Secondary markets are overseen by regulators like the SEC. Institutions do not receive additional funds here.

**Securities** | Securities are negotiable financial instruments that hold monetary value. Types of securities:
- Equity security: Ownership of a company in the form of stocks.
- Debt security: Representation of money that is borrowed and must be repaid. Examples are bonds, certificate of deposits, collatarised securities.
- Hybrid security: A combination of equity and debt securities. Examples are equity warrants, convertible bonds, and preferrence shares.

## Money markets
**Repurchase agreements** | _Repos_ are short-term debt that issuers, like government institutions, sell in the form of Treasury Bills (T-bills) to raise money. The securities are repurchased from the investor the next day or the following week with interest. Repos are low-risk because of the duration of the loan. _Repos_ are from the sellers perspective - the party that needs the funds.

**Reverse repo** | Reverse repos are issued from the buyer's perspective. The buying bank may have excess cash that it wants to monetize in a short period of time. The buying bank purchases the stock of the seller (borrower) as a collaterised overnight loan. In the event the seller defaults (unable to pay back), the buying bank is liquidated to cover the buying bank's losses.

## Derivatives markets

**Options** | Options can be stocks, bonds, ETFs, or mutual funds that give the buyer of the option to exercise his right to buy 

**Call option** | A buyer with a call option has the right, but not the obligation to **buy** a stock at the strike price. If the price of stock rises, the buyer makes a profit by purchasing them at a lower price when the options was written. He then sells the stocks at the high price in the market for a profit. If the price falls, the buyer can choose to let the contract expire. Options come at a high premium because of the risk the seller takes.

**Put option** | A seller with a put option has the right, but not the obligation to **sell** a stock at the strike price. If the price of a stock falls, the seller can sell the stock at the higher price it was before it fell. If the price rises, the seller can choose to let the option expire and sell the stock in the market instead. Like call options, put options have high premiums too. 

**Strike price** | The price at which a derivative can be excercised in the future. In a call option, the strike price is the price at which the buyer can purchase a security. In a put option, the strike price is the price at which the seller can sell a security.

## Spot markets
The spot market is where the value of the securities or commodities are traded immediately. This is in contrast to the futures market where the trades values take place at a future date. Spot markets can also cater to goods sold immediately but ownership is transacted at a later date like crude oil. A company may buy crude oil at the current price but only have the oil delivered in the following month.

**Non-Deliverable Forwards** | An NDF is a forwards contract, usually short-term, between two parties to settle a profit or loss by taking the difference between the agreed rate and the spot rate of a foreign currency. Corporations use NDFs off-shore to hedge against illiquid currencies where the country does not allow the currency to be exchanged.

## Terms
**Proprietary trading** | Financial firms or commercial banks that engage in _prop trading_ invest directly in the market for profit rather than earning commission from clients.

**Long** | A trader owns the shares he intends to sell. This position is used in a bull market. He speculates that stock prices will rise in the future.

**Short** | A trader sells borrowed stocks he does not own. The trader will need to buy the stocks back in the future to return to the owner with interest. This position is used in a bear market. He sells high, speculating that the prices will fall and repurchase them at a lower price. If the stock price rises, the trader makes a loss in buying the borrowed shares to return them.

**Haircut** | A haircut has two definitions with respect to market makers and loans.
- Market makers: A haircut is the small difference between the buy and sell price of a securities in a stagnant market. An investor may buy a stock for $10 and sell them for $10.05 to make a small profit of 5 cents per stock - the haircut.
- Loans: Securities used as a collatoral for a debt may be devalued slightly to provide a cushion for the lender in case the price of the stocks fall. The devaluation is called the haircut. An investment bank may devalue a borrower's share price used as collateral from $100 to $80.
