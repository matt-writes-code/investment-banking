## Derivatives markets

**Options** | Options can be stocks, bonds, ETFs, or mutual funds that give the buyer of the option to exercise his right to buy 

**Call option** | A buyer with a call option has the right, but not the obligation to buy a stock at the strike price. If the price of stock rises, the buyer makes a profit by purchasing them at a lower price when the options was written. If the price falls, the buyer can choose to let the contract expire. Options come at a high premium because of the risk the seller takes.

**Put option** | A seller with a put option has the right, but not the obligation to sell a stock at the strike price. If the price of a stock falls, the seller can sell the stock at the higher price before it fell. If the price rises, the seller can choose to let the option expire and sell the stock in the market instead.

**Strike price** | The price at which a derivative can be excercised in the future. In a call option, the strike price is the price at which the buyer can purchase a security. In a put option, the strike price is the price at which the seller can sell a security.

## Spot markets

**Non-Deliverable Forwards** | An NDF is a forwards contract, usually short-term, between two parties to settle a profit or loss by taking the difference between the agreed rate and the spot rate of a foreign currency. Corporations use NDFs off-shore to hedge against illiquid currencies where the country does not allow the currency to be exchanged.

## Terms
**Proprietary trading** | Financial firms or commercial banks that engage in _prop trading_ invest directly in the market for profit rather than earning commission from clients.

**Long** | A trader owns the shares he intends to sell. This position is used in a bull market. He speculates that stock prices will rise in the future.

**Short** | A trader sells borrowed stocks he does not own. The trader will need to buy the stocks back in the future to return to the owner with interest. This position is used in a bear market. He sells high, speculating that the prices will fall and repurchase them at a lower price. If the stock price rises, the trader makes a loss in buying the borrowed shares to return them.
