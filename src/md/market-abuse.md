# Market Abuse

**Spoofing** | Putting a large purchase order and cancelling it shortly after to create the impression of rising share prices.

**Insider trading** | Purchasing shares with privilleged information usually only available to decision makers of the company before it goes public.

**Front running** | Purchasing shares ahead of someone else after knowing his intention to buy. Brokers are usually privilleged with foreknowledge of their client's intention to buy, especially if they put a market order.

**Round-tripping** | Investors collude of shares to drive up a company's share prices without an increase in the company's actual earnings. Two companies can also round-trip by buying each other's shares.
