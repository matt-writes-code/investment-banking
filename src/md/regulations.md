# Regulations

**MiFID** | Markets in Financial Instruments Directive is a regulation that requires EU financial markets participants to increase transparency.

**MiFID II** | Calls for transparent pricing, reporting of market abuse, trade transparency, regulated use of electronic circuit breakers.

**Dodd-Frank Act** | The Dodd-Frank Act was introduced after the 2008 financial crisis to provide regulatory oversight, consumer protection, and to manage systemic risk in the financial system. The act prevents banks from gambling with consumers' money, monitors risky derivatives, and provides oversight to credit rating agencies.

**Volcker Rule** The rule states that commercial banks cannot use customers' money to invest in high-risk markets or engage in prop trading. The rule is part of the Dodd-Frank Act and was proposed after the 2008 financial crisis.

**LIBOR** | The London Interbank Offered Rate is the average interest rate at which banks charge each other for borrowing money. LIBOR is calculated at the end of the day by collecting self-reported interest rates from banks and averaging them. An increase in LIBOR rates would increase interest rates of credit cards, car loans, and variable mortgage interest rates, making it expensive for consumers. Banks borrow cash from each other to meet regulations which require them to maintain a certain level of cash daily. LIBOR equivalents include the EURIBOR (Europe), SHIBOR (Shanghai), TIBOR (Tokyo), and MIBOR (Mumbai).
