# Corporate Banking
Quick notes and references.

**Sweep accounts** | Sweep accounts are accounts clients can use to maximise returns of interest on unused cash while maintaining working capital. At the end of each business day, extra funds from the other accounts are _swept_ into the sweep account to generate interest, typically in money markets. At the open of the next business day, the funds are moved back for business. Banks charge a fixed fee or take a percentage as commission.
